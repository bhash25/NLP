In this assignment, i have used the SemEval dataset to perform aspect-based sentiment 
analysis. Given a text and the corresponding entity in the "Aspect" column, the task is to 
predict the sentiment/polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of the entity within the text. 
i have used the following three embedding methods: 
1. Frequency-based methods:  TF-IDF (select the top 100 
features (tokens) using the chi-square test to refine your feature set. 
2. Embedding-based methods: Glove trained on google news. 
3. Sentence vectors: pre-trained Sentence-BERT
